Prospective Practicals for 2018:
 - Project Planning & Design: Convert a Problem Description into Plan & Design
 - Workspace Organization & Tools
 - Reuse & Reusability: Find-a-library
 - IO, Big and small
 - High Performance Computing

The practical exercises we have planned for each topic are similar to those in previous years, though we have consolidated them somewhat; while we finalize this year's materials, please feel free to {% include oldlink.md tx='peruse past practicals' l='practice/' %}.
