Week 1 Afternoon Practicals:
{% for ss in site.practical %}- [{{ ss.title }}]({{ ss.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{% endfor %}

The practical exercises we have planned for each topic are similar to those in previous years, though we have consolidated them somewhat; while we finalize this year's materials, please feel free to {% include oldlink.md tx='peruse past practicals' l='practice/' %}.
* Have an on computer exercise
* should build in complexity, at least 3 levels that everyone will do with a few more people that really get it
* Should not entail a lot of Key strokes to do right; the practical time should be most be people struggling with new concepts/ approach not rapid fire typing
* will need a  to prepare code and input to addition to directions
