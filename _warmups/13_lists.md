title: Some Lists

For our last warmum we would like you to implement, in order as you finish them, the following three data structures in Python:

- Stack (Find specs [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/TheStackAbstractDataType.html))
- Queue (Find specs [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/TheQueueAbstractDataType.html))
- Deque (Find specs [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/TheDequeAbstractDataType.html))

By implement, we mean you should create classes in python for each of the above data types, with all of the methods described in their specs pages. So, for example, the Stack class should have a method called "push," which takes in an object and appends it to the stack, and a method called "pop" which returns the most recently pushed object and removes it from the stack.

Find more about stacks [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatisaStack.html), queues [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaQueue.html), and deques [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaDeque.html).
