Why are *you* here?

## Project Focus

*CAMS* is about skills for accomplishing projects.  Part of research is innovation, inspiration, insight, and so on.  But all the great ideas are for naught, if they are not realized in practice.

So when we discuss ideas, we also immediately try them: first in practice, then on work that interests us.  To that end, we asked participants to submit proposed projects and we also selected some projects from our own work.  Each of these is real work, that could be used by other people some day - as published research, as an open-access tool for policymakers, as a library for small business owners.
