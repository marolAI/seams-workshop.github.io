Welcome to the ***Software Engineering for Applied Mathematical Sciences*** (***SEAMS*** for short) Workshop site!

This workshop helps participants develop their skills beyond just basic programming and get them thinking about engineered solutions to their scientific research challenges.  That work is guided by a curriculum covering vital skills for research programming, with coaching by faculty involved in software-intensive science.  Additionally, the participants will undertake a multi-day hack-a-thon on their own research code, culminating in demonstrating the improvements to the workshop attendees.

Applications for the 2018 workshop will open August 1.  The workshop will be held from November 26-December 7 in Muizenberg, South Africa, at the AIMS South Africa site.

***SEAMS*** is made possible by a partnership between [AIMS South Africa](https://aims.ac.za/), [USAFRICOM](https://www.africom.mil), [University of Florida](https://biology.ufl.edu/), [SACEMA](https://www.sacema.org), and other partners.
