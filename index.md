Welcome to the ***Software Engineering for Applied Mathematical Sciences*** (***SEAMS*** for short) Workshop site!  This is the 4th time we have run such a workshop, and we're excited to tailor it to South Africa for the first time!

This workshop helps participants develop their skills beyond just basic programming and get them thinking about engineered solutions to their scientific research challenges.  That work is guided by a curriculum covering vital skills for research programming, with coaching by faculty involved in software-intensive science.  Additionally, the participants will undertake a multi-day hack-a-thon on their own research code, culminating in demonstrating the improvements to the workshop attendees.

Applications for the 2018 workshop {% include lo.md tx='are now open' l='https://goo.gl/forms/nXALwJ7Fn4BUt0lR2' %} and the deadline for submission is ***August 31 (Friday), 2018***.  The workshop will be held from November 26-December 7, 2018 in Muizenberg, Cape Town, South Africa, at the AIMS South Africa site.

For information on past workshops, please see the {% include oldlink.md tx='website' %} for the most recent previous version of the workshop (called CAMS), held in partnership with AIMS Ghana in 2015.

***SEAMS*** is made possible by a partnership between {% include lo.md tx='AIMS South Africa' l='https://aims.ac.za/' %}, {% include lo.md tx='USAFRICOM' l='https://www.africom.mil' %}, {% include lo.md tx='University of Florida' l='https://biology.ufl.edu/' %}, {% include lo.md tx='SACEMA' l='https://www.sacema.org' %}, and other partners.
