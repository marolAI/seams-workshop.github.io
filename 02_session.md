Session focuses for 2018:
 - Project Planning & Design:
    * from pencil & paper into pseudocode
    * breaking up steps & connecting them
    * pseudocode into Makefiles
    * testing: validation, performance, platform
    
 - Workspace Organization & Tools
 - Reuse & Reusability
 - IO, Big and small
 - High Performance Computing

The specific sessions for each topic are similar to those in previous years, though we have consolidated them somewhat; while we finalize this year's materials, please feel free to {% include oldlink.md tx='peruse past sessions' l='sessions' %}.
