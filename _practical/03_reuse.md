title: Reuse & Reusability
---

Goal is to have participants get concrete experience in:
 - arranging their software approach structurally to accommodate using someone else's work
 - ...and writing their software in a way that can be plugged into a different project

For practical warmup, give them five capabilities that are needed, and have them google up appropriate tools or libraries (for their programming language? for any programming language?)

 - for this practical, need a two problems with well-defined holes: think about this in terms of plugging a piece into some manuscript build process
 - first, students implement around a well-described existing solution, then are handed that piece to see how if the whole approach works
 - then they implement against a well-defined hole; circle back to the five capabilities ask them to use one of those for some problem.
