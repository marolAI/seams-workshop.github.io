title: How to Verify and Validate Research Code as You Work
---

For this exercise we would like you to use test driven development (in the language of your choice) to solve Project Euler problem 36: "double-base Palindromes." You should write your own method for converting between base ten and base 2, if it comes up. 

After you have solved the problem, we would like you to submit not only all files you generated to solve the problem, but a file containing all of the tests you wrote in order to develop your solution code.
