    * Code/algorithm analysis
4. Parallelizeable problems
    * Monte Carlo
    * split-apply-combine
    * Amdahl's Law
    * Race conditions
5. HPC environments
    * multithreading
    * clusters/supercomputers
    * cloud/grid computing
    * scheduling jobs
6. Relevant technologies
    * Shared vs. distributed memory
    * OpenMP, MPI, other language-specific libraries
