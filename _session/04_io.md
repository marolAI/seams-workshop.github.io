TBD!

Week 1 Morning Discussion Sessions:
{% for ss in site.session %}- [{{ ss.title }}]({{ ss.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{% endfor %}

The specific sessions for each topic are similar to those in previous years, though we have consolidated them somewhat; while we finalize this year's materials, please feel free to {% include oldlink.md tx='peruse past sessions' l='sessions' %}.
# Discussion questions ?
* Why we should care about the topic and how we should think about it?  

    <!--

    -->
* How should we organize and manage our data?
     <!--

    -->
* How can we automatically gather data? 
    <!--

    -->
* How do we capture / document data cleaning / curation / reshaping process?  
     <!--

    --> 

* How do we share the data ?
    <!--

    -->
* Which formats for which tasks? 
     <!--

    -->
* For outputs: how do we make them repeatable (including stochastic ones). 
     <!--

    -->
* What kind of checkpointing / intermediate outputs / caching should be done? 
     <!--

    -->
* What are the performance characteristics (size + access time) of the data format?
     <!--

    -->

# What is a database ?
<!--
* A database consists of a number of interrelated tables. 
* Each table has a number of records which are used to represent real world objects.
* Each record has a number of fields which are data items used to specify a characteristic of the record. Examples of fields
  (Name, address and gender) with structures to specify the types of data per each field e.g (integer, Characters,)  
* A database management system is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) if different tables are related to each other by  
  common fields, so that information from several tables can be combined.
-->
# When do i use a database?
<!--
* When we want to store and retrieve information. Databases guarantee persistent, reliable access to the data and provide the  
    ability to co-relate data that gets produced in different areas to understand relationships, generate reports to predict trends  
    for the future.  (https://dzone.com/articles/what-are-databases-used-for)    
* Databases are critical to delivering the immediate, personalized, data-driven applications and real-time analytics.

# Trade offs between text files and csv files.

# Text File
* Lack of standards:  
- No standard way to specify data format. No standard way to express “special characters”.  
* Inefficiency:  
- Can lead to massive redundancy (repetition of values). Speed of access and space efficiency for large data sets.  Difficult to store “non-rectangular” data sets.  
* Lack of data integrity:
- lack of data integrity measures

```
Consider a data set collected on two families from the above figure 1.1 .What would this look like as a flat file?  
One possible comma-delimited format is shown below:  
```
John,33,male,Julia,32,female,Jack,6,male
John,33,male,Julia,32,female,Jill,4,female
John,33,male,Julia,32,female,John jnr,2,male
David,45,male,Debbie,42,female,Donald,16,male
David,45,male,Debbie,42,female,Dianne,12,female

```
* Firstly, it is not efficient; the parent information is repeated over and over again.

# Disadvantages of plain CSV files

Just the storage of this number of files presents a challenge:
1.	Storing these files in one directory would cause confusion making it difficult to find files and would make it   
    difficult to remove or modify files.
2.	The next problem is how to name these files. Choosing file names is a form of documentation; the name of the file   should clearly describe the contents of the file, or at least distinguish the contents of the file from the contents of other files in the same directory.
4.  Another thing to consider is how the files will be ordered in directory listings; will it be easy to browse a list of the files in a directory and find the file we want?

# Balance between plain text and human readable string data
* All data can be parsed by a suitably equipped and programmed computer or machine; reasons for choosing binary formats over text formats  
  usually center on issues of storage space, as a binary representation usually takes up fewer bytes of storage, and efficiency of access (input and output) without parsing or conversion.

## Communicating with the outside world
 - examples?

## Important context
 - interactive, human user?
 - quick and dirty?
 - need for speed?
 - rigid specification?

## The options
 {% comment %}
 - STDIO
 - ad hoc text
 - csv, tab, etc.
 - HTML, XML, JSON, etc.
 - binary
 - database
 - specialized file formats (e.g., tiff, hdf5, docx)
{% endcomment %}

 Spend 15-20 minutes researching one of the following topics (to be assigned).
 Write down your answers and be prepared to tell the class what you found.
 1. What are standard out and standard error?  What's the difference, and how 
 do you write to them on the command line and in [your language here].
 2. What is a markup language, and what are some examples?  What advantages
 and disadvantages do markup languages have over simple text?
 3. In your own words, what is database normalization?  What's the point?
 4. Choose a specialized file format, explain when it should be used,
 and what advantage it has over plain text.  

## Parsers
 - existing, established
 - making your own (use the standard, write tests, be fastidious)

{% comment %}
Making choices about input formats: raw text, structured text (e.g., csv),
binary, databases.

What should be input?  Obviously empirical data - slightly less obvious
simulation parameters, even less obvious analysis configuration parameters.
However, often very valuable to be able to have configuration of setup / results
as an input.  Importance of random seed as input.

Making choices about output.  Checkpointing.  Value of checkpointing to debugging,
but also scaling up to supercomputer approaches, use in alternative analysis /
visualization streams or handing off to other researchers.  What to save as
interim results.

What to save as "final" results, and how to save it.  Value of having simulation
outputs AND separate visualization, not just final plots.
