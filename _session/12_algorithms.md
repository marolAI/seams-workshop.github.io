# P vs. NP Stuff

Discuss reductions/ intractability, good examples: 

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring15/cos226/lectures/65Reductions-2x2.pdf

# Data Structures

Will take some examples from  
http://www.careerride.com/Data-Structure-Interview-Questions.aspx

# Dynamics Programming

Go over some sample problems: https://projecteuler.net/problem=81

# Sorting

Will review sorts, instances when to use different sorting (ex. if swaps are super expensive instead of comparisons, use insertion sort)

# Graph Problems

Introduces BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Prim, etc., mostly talk about CS problems as graph theory problems.

# Regexp

Only cover some graph/NFA/DFA representation, properties, mention theorems, etc.

Good overview of theory, last bit about NFA: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs373/fa2010/lectures/lect06.pdf

# Parallelization

Consider problems which can be parallelized, go through problems in:
