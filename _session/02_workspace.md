Why organize?  What's the benefit?  What's the cost?  How do you organize?

## Why Organize Your Workspace?

> ### Exercise: Physical Organization
>
> Now that we have discussed some basic reasons to organize, we are handing out some supplies for a quick exercise.
> Your groups are receiving some envelopes, shape cutouts, and markers.
>
> Your first task is to organize those: *you have 2 minutes*.
>
> Now trade your result with another group, but do not do anything with their result yet:
> we will ask you a question momentarily, which the first group to answer correctly wins.
>
> *After that question*: How did you organize?  How did the other group organize?  What do you think was *bad* about your approach?  What was *good* about theirs?  Write down a few sentences answering these questions: *you have 2 minutes*.
>
> Now you will get more shapes.  Add those to the other group's material; you may also re-arrange their organization: *you have 1 minute, then trade*.
>
> Once everyone has their folders back, we will ask another question.  Again, the first group to answer correctly wins.
>
> After that question: What did the other group do?  Was that consistent with the organization scheme you used?  Why (or why not) do you think that?  Again, write your answers down: *you have 2 minutes*.

## What Does *Organization* Mean In Programming?

> ### Exercise: Computational Organization
>
> Download and unpack [this file](disorganized.zip).
>
> This collection of files is a mess.  It was used to generate the assignment of shapes
> in the previous exercise.
>
> With a partner, re-organize the files.  Spend 5 minutes.  Don't worry about making the code work after your changes (though feel free to do so if you have time).
>
> What do you change?  Why?  Write it down.
>
> Switch seats with another group, without discussing your changes.  What did they change?  Why do you think they did?  Spend 2 minutes.
>
> Now share your changes and reasons with the other group.  What did you like about the other group's approach?  What did they find *confusing* about yours?  Spend 2 minutes.

## Does Organization Relate to *Scientific Communication*?

> ### Exercise: Publication Requirements
>
> With a partner (that you have *NOT* worked with on the previous two exercises), take a look at the [New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/page/author-center/manuscript-submission) manuscript requirements.
>
> What do they actually require?  In 2 minutes: write down 2 distinct requirements.
>
> How does it relate to how you organize your project?  Write something (possibly "It doesn't not") for each of the requirements you identified previously.
>
> We will then discuss these answers as group.
>
> Which of your requirements (and their relations to organization) did other groups mention?

## Tools For Organization: Version Control

First a quiz on `git` commands:

 - how do you clone a repository?
 - once you have a copy, and make changes to a file and then save them, are those changes in the repository?
 - when you have changes in your local copy, how do you get them back into the original repository?
 - how can you see what changes are in the repository?

> ### Exercise: `git` practice.
>
> We have a hat filled with things to do with `git`.  Everyone will get something to do, and a partner.
>
> First, both partners should clone [this repository to the own computers](https://github.com/AIMS-Ghana/gitdemo).
>
> Then, both partners should perform the task on their pieces of paper.
>
> Now, keeping their tasks concealed from each other, the partners should switch computers, and figure out what the other person did and then UNDO that action.

Re-quiz!

## Tools For Organization: Templating

> ### Exercise: Template a Helloworld
>
> We are now going to build the skeleton of a project that we could distribute for others to use.  Depending on which language you prefer, see either:
>
>  - [Python Modern](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/modern-package-template)
>  - [R Devtools](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html)
>
> Using those template tools, create a module or package that provides a single function `hw` that, when invoked, causes "Helloworld" to printed to the screen.
