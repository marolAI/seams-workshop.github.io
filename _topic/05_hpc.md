A working understanding of the physical parts of a computer is important for making decisions about how to make code faster.
- [Here's a basic overview of the parts of a modern desktop computer](http://sites.jmu.edu/103oconnor-16/introduction-to-basic-computer-components-and-functions/)  If you've never built a computer, this might be helpful.

Why is my code slow?
