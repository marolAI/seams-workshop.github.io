SEAMS is about

 - **S***oftware*: useful computer abstractions for transforming inputs into outputs, created by...
 - **E***ngineering*: an organized, systematic approach to design and delivery of reliable, flexible, practical, and human-useable systems for...
 - **A***pplied*: considering empirical data...
 - **M***athematical*: within quantitative, rules-based representations...
 - **S***ciences*: that make testable predictions.

These interpretations can guide the way you approach a new research problem--or, put another way, they can help you with *design* and *planning* for the work that will answer a research question.

# Steps of Design in a Scientific Project

Science revolves around observations, predictions, and experiments. In some cases, this might mean recording and aggregating data from the field. For other disciplines, the work might entail analyzing data from a complex mechanical setup. In traditional laboratory work, researchers keep a detailed record of experimental steps and observations. These elements of the *process* of doing Science should also be present when programming for research.

A deliberate approach to **Design** is one way researchers can ensure that their work meets the high standard of Science.

# Planning

With a project design in mind, researchers can make a plan to accomplish that work.  Important scientific work is increasingly collaborative, and modern communication technology enables those collaborations to occur across continents.  Similar technology makes unprecedented amounts of computational resources available for research.

However, effective use of these advantages requires careful planning.  Software development companies will often adopt formal planning and tracking processes once they reach sufficient size and project complexity.  At SEAMS, we are not covering any of those formal processes directly, but rather focusing on the more fundamental concepts such approaches are intended to address.

At its core, most effective planning is about carefully answering six questions, Who-What-When-Where-Why+How often shortened to 5WH.

<!--
We select participants already know some basics relative to these topics.  You should already know how to "code" -- *e.g.* how to declare variables and functions, read and write files, and generally arrange that syntax in a way that does useful things -- which are the bricks and mortar of Software Engineering (or wires and resistors, whatever your preferred analogy assembles into products).  Similarly, you should already know a bit about research -- *i.e.*, gathering data, formulating and testing hypotheses

## Research

For this workshop, how do we define research?

## The Lab Notebook

Scientists do not leave critical details to fallible memory: we record our observations, and our method to obtain them, in detail.  The reasons to do so might seem obvious, but are worth actively contemplating.  Science is not the pursuit of *my* truth or *your* truth or a *Western* truth or an *African* truth.  We are imperfect creatures in this pursuit, but our standard is *general, objective truth*, not subjective or socially constructed.  The simplest is that our work relies on trust, trust is built by openness, and openness means have an accessible record.

The goal of scientific practice is to expand the usefully understood.  If some phenomena was not previously understood, then it is unlikely to be extremely obvious.
