  <h1 class="page-heading">WELCOME!</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <b>Software Engineering for Applied Mathematical Sciences</b> (<b>SEAMS</b> for short) Workshop site!</p>

<p>This workshop helps participants develop their skills beyond just basic programming and get them thinking about engineered solutions to their scientific research challenges.  That work is guided by a curriculum covering vital skills for research programming, with coaching by faculty involved in software-intensive science.  Additionally, the participants will undertake a multi-day hack-a-thon on their own research code, culminating in demonstrating the improvements to the workshop attendees.</p>

<p>Applications for the 2018 workshop will open August 1.  The workshop will be held from November 26-December 7 in Muizenberg, South Africa, at the AIMS South Africa site.</p>

<p><b>SEAMS</b> is made possible by a partnership between AIMS South Africa, University of Florida, SACEMA, and other partners.</p>
