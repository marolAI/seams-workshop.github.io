Prepare the discussion session material for XYZ topic. The target file is `_session/XX_YYYYY.md`.

The session material is whatever you plan to present on screen (e.g., slides), plus any distributed materials (e.g., code snippet) ideally with source (e.g., electronic version of something you make a hardcopy of).

Slides will either be reveal.js based (in which case, you'll prep them in Markdown) or Google Slides (in which, case you'll use the template and provide a link).  More to follow on specific steps to take, but the rough solution outline with look like "specify which of those options in yaml; if google, provide link; generated page will do the work of loading proper display."
