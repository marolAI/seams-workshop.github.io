<!--
You should have a project, possibly as part of a team (if so, see note at end of this page), after yesterday.

Now you will need to create a space for your real project.

Using the same approach you developed for the practice projects, make a space for your workshop project.  After you organize the filesystem and repository for this project, you should gather any existing material you have and add it (as appropriate) to the repository.

Depending on the language for this project, you should also apply a template (*e.g.*, to deliver the project as an *R* package) to your project.

You should also set up the appropriate arrangements to meet you publication goal.  For example, if its a journal publication, then create a stub for that publication.  If it's a web-based interactive version of your science, get that component sorted.

Finally, turn your project definition into a series of steps on GitHub as issues and grant the appropriate permissions for the project.

As with yesterday, and the rest of the project sessions, you will need to present a 1-minute update on your project at the end of the session.  The point of these updates is to show how you thought about the topic (general workspace organization in this case) and what you did with that thinking.  For example, it probably makes sense to show what folders and files you laid out, how you translated your project definition from yesterday into specific issues.

You should feel free to ask questions of any faculty during this session, but try to stick the faculty member that is designated for your group.
