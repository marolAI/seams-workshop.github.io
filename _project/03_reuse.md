title: Reuse & Reusability
---

Exercise.  Make some part of your project reusable

1. Initial conception.  Identify a part of your project that might be carved off as a re-usable package.  You might do this solely for yourself and your colleagues, or for a broader set of users. 
   * what does the package do?  
   * what would it be used for?  who would use it?   
   * what would be the dependencies? 
   * what do you know about how to generate and disseminate such a package? 
2. Planning.  Map out the steps to make a package. 
   * what is required by the chosen package dissemination system, e.g., CRAN? 
   * what additional documentation would need to be written?
   * what changes in file naming and organization would be useful? 
   * what new tests, if any, would be helpful?
