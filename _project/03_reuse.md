## Separation of Concerns Exercise
Take 30 minutes and draw a diagram illustrating how the major parts of your
project code will interact.  The number of components should probably be in
the range of 3 to 8.  Add some notes to describe how the components interact.

When you have completed your diagram, show it to your advisor (one of the
course instructors).  Address any problems and then continue working on your
course projects.
