Week 1 Afternoon Project Work:
{% for ss in site.project %}- [{{ ss.title }}]({{ ss.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
{% endfor %}

We are taking a different approach to project work preparation this year; however, last year's project work assignments still provide good perspective on what kind of tasks you might have for this workshop.  While we finalize this year's materials, please feel free to {% include oldlink.md tx='peruse past project-related tasks' l='projwork' %}.
