[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a great site for finding answers to coding questions (and for asking new ones if you can't find what you seek).

But!

There is a whole network of *Stackexchange* sites, some of which concern puzzles (amongst other delightfully nerdy subjects).

For today's warmup, you should visit two of them: [Puzzling](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/) and [Codegolf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/).

Try at least the following problems (without looking at the answers already submitted!):

 - [Math symbol Tricks](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/16796/math-do-you-enjoy-it-really)
 - [Pi Day](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/10972/pi-day-puzzle-one-to-twenty)
 - [88 pies](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/8662/a-puzzle-about-baking-88-pies)
 - [Leap Seconds!](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/52452/leap-for-leap-seconds)
 - [Milk Expiration](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/33033/has-my-milk-expired)
 - [Chinese Zodiac](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/19041/calculate-chinese-zodiac-sign)
