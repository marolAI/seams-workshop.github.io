Week 1, each day will focus on one of our [Topics](/topic/).  We start each day with a [Warmup](/warmup/): a simple programming-related puzzle or exercise.  We then shift into the [Discussion Session](/session/), where the faculty engage participants in the important ideas & practices in the day's topic; these sessions are very interactive, and include several partnered mini-exercises.  In the afternoon, we move to the lab.  First, to complete a [Practical](/practical/) example problem tailored the day's topic.  Lastly, the participants close out each day working through a series of tasks applied to *their own projects*; the faculty prepare these challenge lists to exceed what can be accomplished in the available time, so participants will be able to choose what aspects of their work they want pursue in greater depth.

A quick review of the Week 1 topics:

 - Project Planning & Design
 - Workspace Organization & Tools
 - Reuse & Reusability
 - IO, Big and small
 - High Performance Computing
 
Over the course of Week 1, participants will also be developing a plan to work on their personal projects.  During Week 2, they will work against that plan in a week-long hack-a-thon, culminating in demonstrating their improved project on Friday.  Each day in Week 2 will have multiple scheduled, one-on-one check-ins with faculty to discuss progress and brainstorm through any hurdles.  As needed by the participants, there may also be detailed technical tutorials run as short breakout sessions.  These will focus on specific technologies that several participants are struggling with, rather than the overarching focuses of the workshop.

**Expect to work long days during Week 2!**
